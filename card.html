			<p id="interesting-fact">You certainly know that the giraffe is the tallest animal in the world, but did you know that the giraffe needs just about five to 30 minutes of sleep in a day? You certainly wish you were a giraffe right now!</p>
			<ul id="facts">
				<li><span class="span">Scientific Name</span>: Giraffa</li>
				<li><span class="span">Average Length</span>: 18 ft</li>

			<p id="summary">There are many more reasons to be a giraffe for a day. It can consume up to 45kg of leaves in a day yet it remains sticky thin, can drink water once in several days and yet not be dehydrated, gives birth standing up - oh how regal - and lives up to 25 years! So next time you are told to eat your veggies, be like the giraffe and you will grow up strong and healthy.</p>
